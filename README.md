# TOTP for Tcl

A lightweight Tcl library implementing Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) algorithm according to **RFC 6238**. Compatible with Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, Authy, and other standard authenticator applications.

## Features

- ✅ RFC 6238 compliant TOTP implementation
- ✅ Generate cryptographic secrets for new users
- ✅ Create `otpauth://` URIs for QR code generation
- ✅ Validate TOTP codes with configurable time-drift tolerance
- ✅ Zero external dependencies (uses Tcl's built-in `sha1` and `base32` packages)
- ✅ Simple, clean API

## Installation

1. Copy the `totp0.1` directory to your Tcl library path
2. Add it to your `auto_path` if needed
3. Load the package:

```tcl
package require totp
```

## Quick Start

### Generate a Secret for New User

```tcl
package require totp

# Generate a random Base32 secret
set secret [::totp::generate_secret]
# => "JBSWY3DPEHPK3PXP" (example)

# Create otpauth:// URI for QR code
set uri [::totp::get_uri $secret "user@example.com" "MyApp"]
# => "otpauth://totp/MyApp:user@example.com?secret=JBSWY3DPEHPK3PXP&issuer=MyApp"

# Display QR code to user (using external tool)
exec qrencode -o qr.png $uri
```

### Validate User's Code

```tcl
# User enters 6-digit code from their authenticator app
set user_code "123456"
set stored_secret "JBSWY3DPEHPK3PXP"

if {[::totp::validate $stored_secret $user_code]} {
    puts "Authentication successful"
} else {
    puts "Invalid code"
}
```

## API Reference

### `::totp::generate_secret ?length?`

Generates a random Base32-encoded secret key.

- **length** (optional): Length of the secret (default: 16)
- **Returns**: Base32 string

```tcl
set secret [::totp::generate_secret]
set longer_secret [::totp::generate_secret 32]
```

### `::totp::get_uri secret account issuer`

Creates a standard `otpauth://` URI for QR code generation.

- **secret**: Base32 secret key
- **account**: User identifier (email, username, etc.)
- **issuer**: Your application/service name
- **Returns**: URI string

```tcl
set uri [::totp::get_uri $secret "alice@example.com" "MyService"]
```

### `::totp::validate secret_base32 input_code ?window?`

Validates a TOTP code against the secret.

- **secret_base32**: Base32 secret key
- **input_code**: 6-digit code from user
- **window** (optional): Time-drift tolerance in 30-second steps (default: 1)
- **Returns**: 1 if valid, 0 if invalid

```tcl
if {[::totp::validate $secret "123456"]} {
    # Code is valid
}

# Check with larger time window (±60 seconds)
if {[::totp::validate $secret "123456" 2]} {
    # Code is valid within ±60 seconds
}
```

### `::totp::get_current_code secret_base32`

Gets the current valid TOTP code. Useful for testing and debugging.

- **secret_base32**: Base32 secret key
- **Returns**: Current 6-digit code

```tcl
set current_code [::totp::get_current_code $secret]
puts "Current code: $current_code"
```

### `::totp::time_remaining`

Returns seconds remaining before the current code expires.

- **Returns**: Integer from 0 to 29

```tcl
set seconds [::totp::time_remaining]
puts "Code expires in $seconds seconds"
```

## Dependencies

- `sha1` package (standard with Tcl)
- `base32` package (standard with Tcl)

## Example Usage

See [EXAMPLE.md](EXAMPLE.md) for detailed usage examples and integration patterns.

## Security Considerations

- Store secrets securely (encrypted database, secure storage)
- Use HTTPS when transmitting secrets or QR codes
- Implement rate limiting on validation attempts
- Consider requiring TOTP only for sensitive operations
- The `generate_secret` function uses `rand()` which is not cryptographically secure; consider using `/dev/urandom` or similar for production
